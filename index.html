                        correct: 1,
                        explanation: "The median is a measure of central tendency, representing the middle value when data is arranged in order. Standard deviation, range, and variance are all measures of dispersion or spread.",

                        explanation: "A skewness value of zero indicates that the distribution is perfectly symmetrical, meaning the left and right sides of the distribution mirror each other.",

                        explanation: "In Excel, the AVERAGE function calculates the arithmetic mean of a range of values. MEAN and AVG are not standard Excel functions, and SUM only adds values without dividing by the count.",

When making predictions, approximately 68% of actual values will fall within ±1 RMSE of the predicted value (assuming normally distributed errors). So there's about a 68% chance that the actual CLV will be between $1,500 ± $250, or $1,250 to $1,750.",

                            "RMSE gives us the typical prediction error, so the actual value is likely within $250 of our prediction. It's like saying your pizza will arrive in 30 minutes, give or take 5 minutes.",
